# Scheduling Program

## Compilation

You should be able to compile this by running `make`, which should output an
binary executable `./main` to run.

```
> make
> ./main
```

If the executable doesn't have the correct permissions straight away (it does
on my system, but sometimes it differs), simply run:

``
> chmod +x main
``
